Frontend component.
Deadbool is built on top of reactjs.
All the relevant code is located in "react" subdirectory.
"app.js" is used to serve the statically prebuilt react app.

NOTE: Right now there is no way to run full app without a server,
as it is tightly integrated with the server.

React components (only listing main components):

- globalMain: shim layer connecting game and the more page.
- more: page with additional info about other games / content.
- game:
  - gameMain.js: shim layer connecting menu and the actual game.
  - gameMenu: menu components
    - menu.js: main menu file. All other components are instantiated here.
  - gamePlay: playing components
    - gamePlay.js: main controller file.
    - gameFrame.js: rendering on the main game frame.
    - physics.js: handles all the game control logic.
    - serverStateFetcher.js: handles all the websocket communications with backend.
