All deadbool repos.

Folders have to be called explicitly as below because monitor service checks corresponding git hashes:
"backend",
"frontend",
"operator".
Above sources are enough to run the full application.

"monitor" service is a health checker that helps to automate the development process.

Note that also by existing convention there should be one server running
operator + frontend + monitor (called "operator server"),
and multiple backend servers (called "backend server").

Monitor has to run on the same instance as operator, as it reads cached backend info dumped by the latter.

Note that it was tried to serve frontend content statically from the storage,
but it is very slow. Looks like serving from a dedicated server has much faster loading speed.

Note that we use "pm2" as a service lifecycle manager on top of npm.

Instructions to run locally (linux/macos):

1. Install npm
2. Open 3 terminal windows and run (installing is not required on the subsequent runs):
   2a. cd backend ; npm install; npm start
   2b. cd operator ; npm install; npm start
   2c. cd frontend/react ; npm install; npm start
3. Open localhost:3000 in browser
4. To stop simply kill with ctrl+c (or close terminal)
